__label__2 Simple way to describe feelings to a little one.: My 5 and 3 year old love this book therefore I love it also. It is very simple with great artwork. I would recommend it to someone who is trying to teach a little one how to use words for emotions. My girls also like trying to make the faces.
__label__2 Memories with my son reading together-Worth the money: I heard about this book while watching TV one day. I decided to purchase it. It's great. It's not too long and not too short. Easy to read. My son is 3 years old and is saying the words along with me. Words like HAPPY, DISAPPOINTED, FRUSTRATED, JEALOUS, SILLY, SCARED, BORED. It's really a great book and worth more than what I paid. The memories will last a life time.
__label__2 Wonderful, inspiring, emotional, colorful illustrations!: I saw this book recently at a neighborhood bookstore and I fell in love with the illustrations recently. (Another reviewer) said that these characters were "cold" but I completely disagree. They are full of life, exuberance and fun, perfect for young children to identify with and express how they feel.This book is a delight and I'll be giving it to a few children for Christmas!
__label__2 Love it!: The beautiful illustrations are tons of fun & the words are wonderful! I brought this book for my 5 yr old who we adopted and 3 1/2 and has all sort of feelings he usually acts out on. The book gave us a way to discuss recognizing and articulating feelings, and how to deal with them in an appropriate ways.
__label__1 Just didn't resonate with me: I found very little "warrior" about this book unless you mean the stealth, meditating warrior within. Don't get me wrong, there are some really, REALLY good meditation exercises, but I found this book just scratching a surface and not "meaty" enough. I also found some of his ideas hard to grasp (five sided pyramid? It took me several minutes to realize that they only way that could be done is to lop off the top so there would then be a flat part & you could have that be a side...he never explains this) and he was extremely redundant. Also, his habit of summarizing every chapter at the end was very annoying - it reminded me of textbooks from school. I really loved his first book and have great admiration & respect for Mr. Cuhulain, but this book was just not my cup of tea. Wiccan, yes...but largely I felt more into Eastern Meditation & metaphysical concepts.
__label__2 Wickedly Funny....: J.P. Donleavy's manual for social climbers is the most amusingly cynical book I've ever read. Though addressed to the modern parvenu, the author uses pseudo-18th century language to satirize social pretensions, instructing the reader on how to behave in every context, what to wear, what home to inhabit, how to deal with neighbors, whom to flatter and whom to disdain. My favorite entry: "Upon the Pointy Two-Tone Shoe."
__label__1 won't drink the coolaid twice: Have the same problems with the VAIO latop battery, it just stopped working (the battery with the original laptop purchase). Logged on to Amazon with the intent to buy a new one, but was a) outraged by the price ($200 is 1/5 of the way toward a new laptop), b) convinced by the other reviews in this page that I would buy a battery with, likely, the same problems and life.Thanks, all, for putting in your prior reviews on the Sony Battery...
__label__1 Hurts your laptop's value: This is a terrible battery. Mine now loses its recharge in about 15 minutes. I was so frustrated to discover the poor quality of this battery, and to realize that I don't have a laptop anymore, I have a paperweight. Shame on Sony, who sit by quietly and don't try to make amends to the owners of these batteries. I have already seen other, smaller quality problems with other Sony products, but now, for sure I won't be buying any Sony product again for fear of the little surprises like this that can skunk my investment.
__label__2 Remarkably easy to use: This small book is easy to understand and easy to use. This system of divination is based in Tibetan Buddisum but anyone can easily apply the fundamentals. You begin by asking for guidance in what to use, and what to discard in the reference material. You begin by quieting your mind, chants are provided for focus. You select a question you wish to ask, you then roll a single dice twice. You may caste the dice for yourself, or another. You record the number rolled on each throw, and look up those combinations in the reference. A wide range of areas (family, goals, business, money, health, etc. - 10 in all) are covered for each combination, providing a "general climate" (positive/neutral/negative) for the current personal and earth energies occuring at that moment in time. While my copy came with a traditional dice, any traditional six sided dice can be used. Personal experince has found the method informative and useful.
__label__2 a camcorder will actually carry and use regularly: After having used full-size Vhs camcorder then Hi-8, it is a pleasure to carry and use this unit. I looked at all of the new breed of digital units and chose this one. It is easier to hold and use than the PC-1 or the Elura and it has a larger screen on the side and takes Sony's new Memory stick. I am very pleased, this one won't sit in my closet waiting gor absolute special events.
__label__1 Best of the Isley Brothers: Not what I expected! The song selection look good, however the product menu would not let you sample the songs. The CD cover shows front & back. If you could magnify the back cover so you could read the information, you would fine every song has some Rap/Hip Hop artist talking over the Isley Brothers' songs. This was not in the product description or I wouldn't have purchased it. This is the most horrendous CD I have ever encountered and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
__label__2 A gentler side of Beethoven.: For the most part, this is a very nice CD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because a couple of pieces had poor recording quality. I could hear background noise. Perhaps they were live recordings. Still, a nice CD overall. I like this softer more gentle side of Beethoven. Very beautiful and enjoyable.
__label__2 Works well: This fan replaced 2 smaller fans on my custom 1980 Turbo Crolla that I thought would have been better. To my surprise, I was wrong. This is a great fan. My overheating days are over. Great fan for the price.
__label__1 Not real great: Aside from the competent performances of Douglas Jimerson and Jill Worley, the singers and musicians on this CD are rather poor. But the recording is worse - poor quality, and done in such a way as to emphasize defects in the presentation. Whenever David Calib comes in with the drums, everything else is drowned out. Did they put the mike _in_ the drum? Sounds like it. The best numbers were those with Jimerson soloing with only a piano backup. It was therefore very disappointing to hear "All Quiet Along the Potomac" as a trumpet/drum instrumental. All this is not to mention the quibble that the album's connection with Robert E. Lee is a bit strained. Aside from "How Firm a Foundation," most of the songs have very little to do with Lee aside from the fact that his family might conceivably have had the sheet music lying around the house, or they were popular during/after the wars he took part in. Be that as it may, I'm sorry to say that three-quarters of the CD is barely listenable.
__label__1 BEWARE: NOT ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL AND GUITAR WHEN YOU USE THE HANGERS. WILL CAUSE THE GUITAR TO HIT WALL EACH TIME YOU USE IT. UNLESS YOU TAKE YOU TIME AND ENSURE THAT THE GUITAR IS IN THE RIGHT POSITION AND THERE IS MINIMUM MOVEMENT. FINDING STUDS IN THE WALL CAN ALSO BE AN ISSUE. IF YOU DON'T SCREW IT INTO THE STUD THE UNIT MIGHT NOT BE SECURE ENOUGH.I WENT WITH THE HERCULES TRI STAND AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.
__label__2 Great Product: These look great hanging on the wall and hold my guitars well. I bought too of them and have been impressed. They are adjustable and do what they claim.
__label__2 Just fine: Shipped in time. Just what I have expected. looks nice and fits to both acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to screw it on the wall.
__label__2 nice product: Nice looking. kind of like buying a happy meal, the surprise is the seeing which one is inside. the color and style is a crap shoot. i wanted oak but got maple. might buy 5 hoping one is the color i want then return the rest. The price was great i shopped around and could not find anything cheaper. holds up well. I got all the peices and screws. does look nice. small enough the color probably wont mater.
__label__2 It is easy to install and priced right: There is not a whole lot to say about this guitar hanger, but it sure is nice to have the guitar off the floor and easily accessible. I'm really glad I bought this.
__label__2 String Swing Guitar hanger: My husband ordered 4 of these. I know that the discription says "shades may vary"...we got 3 in a light walnut shade and 1 of them was a dark brown. You would think that if its all the same order then they would send all one color. Oh well. When all the guitars are hung up you can hardly tell. It was really easy to install and they look great.
__label__2 Cheaper than Guitar center! Sort of...: Ordered these to get a couple of my guitars out of the corner of my room. They took a little longer than I hoped to arrive, but not much. Easy to install if you have a drill/driver. Worked perfect for my needs. I have bought them from Guitar Center before and unless they are on sale they are generally $5 more there. Very happy with my purchase.
__label__1 A few lost cities and a lot of rubbish: I read this looking for more information on the various sites but was greatly disappointed. There is some description of several sites along with a lot of wild speculation and questionable history. About a third way through the book changes into an wandering very stupid hitch hiking travelogue of South America. Describing how he got lucky with a girl in a bar is not a monumental event.A sorry waste of time and money.
__label__2 Outstanding!: Love this toothpaste. It's a natural product, and helps improve gum disease. I've struggled with slight gum irritationg for a couple of years and Thieves toothpate combined with the Thieves mouthwash has improved my gums. As a diabetec good oral hygene is critical.
__label__2 easy, interesting read: As an avid student of Native American history, I found this to be a fine "sitting by the fire" read. It contained enough technical info to keep it from being simplistic and tied together a lot of emerging information about the possible settling of the new world by sea. This area of great conflict among archaeologists deserves a lot more study than it is currently getting. Hopefully, this volumn will direct the interest of more people in this direction.My five-star rating is based on this being a very interesting book on it's own to many people without extensive knowlege in the field, not to be compared with more technical volumes directed more toward hard-core professionals or academics.I only wish there had been more photos, clearer photos and photos of artifacts, work sites and locations mentioned in the text rather than of people standing around.
__label__1 More an Autobiographical Account than Support of a Theory: Mr. Koppel is a skillfull prose writer, but the facts, theories and evidence in his book are interspersed few and far between. This makes it easy and fun to read, but left me starving for the archeological meat and potatoes that I had bought the book for in the first place.So, to those who enjoy reading themselves to sleep to well-written travel narratives with stories of mild adventure, I do recommend "Lost World". But, those just interested in a fact-filled presentation of the "before Clovis, by boat" theory of the peopling of the Americas and its supporting evidences will likely be disappointed with this book. To them I recommend instead the book "Bones, Boats and Bison."
__label__1 not properly packaged- cannot use: This cart comes without any protective packaging (it's sent in a cardboard box that fits the folded cart exactly- no padding, no protective layer, not even any sturdy cardboard corners to keep the flimsy box from collapsing), so of course it is bent when it arrives and you can't use it. If it had arrived in good condition, it probably would have been a decent cart, but I wouldn't take my chances on that (am ordering a replacement from a different company).
__label__1 bummer: Looks great, wonderful size, perfect if it only stayed together... worked for a few days before the front wheels fell off and a few weeks before the rear wheels fell off.
__label__1 Not authors: A choice excerpt:"The best way to start writing a class is to decide what you want it to do. For this, a Python-based modelof refrigerator behaviors, Fridge, is the first thing, and it should be basic. While you're thinking aboutit, focus on what you will need a particular Fridge object to do for your own purposes. You wantenough behaviors available that this object can be used to make food, yet you don't want to worry aboutaspects of real-life refrigerators that won't be included in a simplified example, such as temperature, thefreezer, defrosting, and electricity--all of these are unnecessary details that would only complicate ourpurpose here. For now, let's just add to the docstring for the Fridge class to define the behaviors thatyou will be building soon."Did an editor even look at this?
__label__1 below average book: The book is very annoying, actually i found the style of the authors rather heavy,easy topics are explained difficult to understand, which shows the luck of experience in writing technical books.This actually should be the difference between an Internet tutorial and a book.
__label__2 Masque: I really appreciate Andrea Kane's writing style. Her stories are colorful and very realistic. She keeps the stories rolling along with her wit and humor.One "little deception" can land a Duke in the Parson's Trap quicker than steamy kisses with a beautiful virgin.
__label__1 No manual and no markings.... Can't install: The gauge came with no manual and no markings on the back to tell you what wire goes where.The oil pressure gauge has 3 bolts for wires. I know from my previous gauge that the middle one is to the oil pressure sending unit, but the left and right ones can be either negative or positive. Since I've already blown one because mine wasn't stock and the positive and negative were reversed, I don't want to hook this up until I know what goes where. How hard would it be to mark the back of the gauge for easy hookup?
__label__1 looks good doesn't last long: really liked the styling of this toaster and the reviews were good, but the reviews that were bad for this product are what I should have listened to. after only a few months the spring in the left side started getting weak and would not return the waffles all the way up. I then started using the right side and it has been better, but alas the spring in that side is weak as well. besides that the toasting quality is good but not returning the waffles back up thing is essential to my toasting of anything.
__label__1 Disappointing: THis book doesn't really offer information for doing a brunch. It has a limited amount of recipes. Some of them are as obvious as adding fruit and milk to store purchased granola. Or ones like adding icecream to coffee. There are much better breakfast books and brunch information than this book.
__label__2 Entertaining and Enlightening: You will be hard pressed to find a better work of historical fiction than the "Siege of Krishnapur." Mr. Farrell does an exceptional job of conveying both the horror and the farce that defined the Indian Mutiny. He skewers the British for their imperialistic follies and myopic ambitions, and he does so in an understated and droll manner that will frequently cause you to chuckle. Both the characters and the plot are expertly developed, and the combat scenes will have you turning the pages faster than you can imagine. Highly recommended.
__label__1 More like a prelude: I read 38% into the book without getting to anything about the actual siege. The book should be rename to something like Prelude and Events leading up to the siege of...
__label__1 The Ant No-No: It was hard for my kids to learn how to do. When they learn how to play the game, it was not fun anymore.
__label__2 Completing the line: It is not really a text book to study taiji in sense of a modern book. But it is a good summary of its predecessors. It collects some missing translations, sums up older books, adds details and so on. Not a required reading but a standard part in each Taijiquan Collection in your book shelf esp if you are interested in the Yang family style.
__label__2 Total agree: The Second cd is best, Mixed very well, good, dark, hard, I paid 25 for it at a local shop, soo I was dissappointed at first, I honestly dont even touch the first cd after I listened to it, unless to mix. The second is the mixed version with a few extras. I like it for the most, I love a few songs a lot... good addition for the used price!
__label__2 Great Convenient Bag: I live in NYC and this bag is great to carry or stroll on the trains. I've pulled this bag through rain and snow and it's durable and sturdy. I like the fact the bag can fold which is better than those other shopping bags with wheels that don't. I wish the handles were a bit longer, but other than that it's what I was looking for.
__label__2 folding shopping bag: This is the second of this product we have. We keep one in each vehicle to use when shopping, and they come in very handy, especially due to the folding wheels.
__label__2 A page turner: This was a very good book. In this book Luke got to see the world outside his farm and school and see what is like to be a baron. Sometimes I got confused reading this about why Luke thought someone was right or wrong but overall this book was intreging and suspenseful. I recommend it to anyone who liked the last three books.
__label__2 YOU GO HADDIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Wow words cannot even describe how great and captivating this book is. It keeps you guessing the whole way through. A good book should be a thrill ride and this was!!!!! I mean hey wat r u doing still at your desk reading this get out and Buy It NOW!!!!!!
__label__1 It works, but the gas is horrible: I suffer from occasional problems with being regular, so I've been enjoying the yogurt which works fine. I wanted to get rid of the calories, so I tried this.There's no doubt that it works, but THE GAS is horrible. This is my 10th day and it has NOT gone away. I'm giving it only 12 days, then I have to quit because it's just awful.The product does work, but the side effects...yikes!
__label__2 Good stuff: Probiotics are a life saver for those of us with IBS. I think one pill a week is enough though I don't need to reestablish the little bug colony more than that. I love this product.
__label__2 Gene Hackman: Exciting Western. Gene Hackman plays a great bad-guy. Russell Crowe and Gary Sinese are good on the eyes as is Sharon Stone.
__label__1 can't believe this is a Bob's Red Mill product: Normally I love the Bob's Red Mill products, but I made this one, had a couple slices from it and ended up throwing it out. It came out hard and barely tasted like cinnamon raisin. I would recommend a bunch of their other products (especially the pizza mix) but I would advice against buying the cinnamon raisin bread mix.
__label__1 They forgot the salt: I like low salt, lite salt no salt. So if I am complaining about a lack of salt they forgot the salt in the batch I bought. Texture was fine flavor was BLAH.
__label__1 printable not wearable: My first black and color cartridge was fine and worked okay (did run out of ink slightly faster than I anticipated). When I opened the next black cartridge package ink poured out of package and all over my shirt and jeans. The same happened with the next color cartridge. I have seen better deals, but I figured you get what you pay for. Not in this case. It cost me the price of this product and two pairs of jeans and two shirts. Not really worth it.
__label__2 Great But Flawed: I loved this book, the author was really insightful with the episodes he chose to review, the non-episode articles are also intelligantly written, often humerous and enjoyable. Where I think the book fails is that it doesn't cover the whole of seaon 8/9, only selected episodes, the episode in which Mulder appears. This is because the book has a shipper heart through and through and is intent on covering the Mulder and Scully relationship. Fair enough but I would have loved to see what the author thought of more non-shipper episodes. It isn't very comprehensive in that regard but still a good read.
__label__2 Yes!: Yes! Another great find among all the bland crap that is passed off as good crime writing. This guy is another killer with a keyboard.
__label__2 Interesting but a downer....: A pretty good first novel but what a grim view of a side of life I am glad I not involved in. Compelling and strange with a resolution that seemed too pat. It was hard to put down although. :)
__label__1 Interesting raw material in dire need of editing: I don't mind music that stretches my attention span. After a few listens, it might even grow on me. I might detect new subtleties that bring color to what seemed like a bleak landscape at first. Laibach demands that kind of long-term relationship from the listener. However, there's a difference between daring minimalism and simple laziness. This album may have interesting moments, but the moments are not fused into interesting songs. It's a good novel that skipped the editing stage and sailed directly to the bookshelf. Furthermore, the endearing croak of Laibach's lead singer is absent, further alienating a Laibach stalwart like me. Oh well. I listen to this one in the background when I'm cooking sometimes. I stop clanging the dishes when I know a good passage is coming. I wouldn't even consider using other Laibach stuff as "background" music.
__label__1 If you are sanding this mask is almost useless: This mask, although capturing small particle if they are actually attempted to be sucked in through the mask would work great. However, with only one strap it does not form a tight seal, so dust is sucked in around the edges.I just finished trying it for an hour of sanding with 80 grit and although I was sure to make it fit as well as possible I'm still coughing up dust.
__label__2 What Level Am I?: All I can say is the game is really(2x) great its interesting and very, very exciting. But I guess the game is too short for the players to reach their maximum level of 30, you could finish the game without even getting close to it. Please try to work on this...Thanks.
__label__1 Doesn't live up to the standard of the original or BG2.: This was one of the more expensive expansion packs I've ever seen, but sadly, it was also one of the shortest. Though the story of the game is okay, there is really not much new for this, other then the graphical enhancements made in Baldur's Gate 2 that they back ported to IWD. The new monsters (actually new, not old ones with a new skin) can be counted on one hand, and other then one of them - the final boss, they are kind of boring. Unless you have money to burn, this game should be passed on...
__label__2 Wonderful: Truly a amazing CD!!! This is the first time I bought this artist CD and I became a instant fan. She is truly anointed by God a must hear!!!
__label__2 Easy and thoroughly enjoyable read: I picked up this book while working our school library's Scholastic Book Sale fundraiser. I was looking for something I could pick up and put down in between customers. Unfortunately, I couldn't put the book down. I am not a good reader, usually lean towards books with short chapters and rarely finish any book. I finished this book so quickly I was shocked and sad when the last chapter came to an end.I am not an educator but I am a parent of a very intellectual 3rd grader. He has a male teacher this year for the first time and I read a few passages from your book. He laughed so hard his mouth hurt. I thanked Mr. Done for giving parents a peek-a-boo view into the lives of our kids and the teachers who spend their days with them.It was thoroughly entertaining and enlightening.
__label__2 Love it!: After downloading this cd on a music site i wont mention a few months ago which didnt have all the bonus track on it like this one does. I broke down and bought this one. There is many good songs on here including some of the bonus tracks. There is only a couple weak songs but overall a very good cd to have. When i bought the cd a week and half ago it was 12.99. Now i see Amazon is raising price again. I dont understand why all these old cds arent cheaper, remastered or not i usually dont like to spend more then 10 bucks on a cd. I would like to get maybe her first cd to, but now i see Amazon has raised the price to over 14 bucks! CRAZY!!
__label__2 Back in time: It's just like a dear old friend is back in my life. I realized that Lisa Hartman was a part of my youth (especially during her time on "Knots Landing" from 1982-86).I knew this perticular album before, I still must have the LP somewhere...Lisas singing skills are improved since her first album- any song on that album is perfectly performed. It is such a shame that Lisa didn't get more credit as a singer. I know that she is doing country music with her husband today- but what about doing a musical like "Annie get your gun" or "Tommy" on Broadway?The selection of bonus tracks is superbly chosen what made me giving that re-release the highest ratings possible.
__label__2 Cookbook: My mother had this. I got this one as a present. It's got all the 'old-world' recipes. I haven't tried them all, but it's got what I want.
__label__2 Looks like Darth Vader bust: I have this on my desk at work and always get compliments on it. I've had it for over 10 years and it still looks fantastic. Easy to put together and very durable. Great for any Sith.
__label__1 Instant beverage coaster...simply awful.: BUYER BEWARE! Based on all the positive reviews of this album, I decided to jump in and try it. I was terribly disappointed. This is just a bunch of blips and beeps that sound like they came right out of a Casio keyboard with what sounds like Japanese girls yelling "We love dancing! Yay!" over and over again. The music is totally inane, riddiculous, uninventive, unappealing, non-melodic, and tiresome. It remids me of a soundtrack to a second rate Japanese childrens' video game. Even if you can get into the kitsch appeal of this release more than I could, I highly doubt this is a title that will stand up to repeated listening. I have an extensive music collection of over six-thousand CD's spanning nearly every genre, and this one honestly rates among the worst I have ever purchased. Pass on this one!
__label__2 An invaluable help: Noel Hume compiled this wonderful treasury of ceramics mostly from his personal collection. This book is invaluable in my Colonial Archaeology class. Even if you are midly interested in ceramics, this beautifully illustrated book is an easy read, and very informative.
__label__1 Let Down once again!: My favorite Jet is an F/A-18 E Super Hornet! But i was hoping that Digital Integration would have done more than creat a game with only good ideas.Graphics are poor period!I have read the readme file and tried to slow down features on a already poor graphics situation and it still locks up sooner or later!I'm running a G-Force II with an Intel Pentium III and a Full Sound Blaster Live. I have no problems with any of my other games.If only they would have made this NAVY Flight sim as good as Falcon 4.0.As far as the Hornet world is concerned,"Janes" still is number one!This game is a bummer and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone since the company couldn't write the program to make it worth much!Marc :[
__label__1 F/A-18E Super Hornet Gold: The only "Gold" in this sim is in the title. I had to look at the CD twice to make certain I hadn't loaded the first version in error. Shame on them for charging this much money for nothing more than a campaign upgrade, to an already poor sim. I do not recommend this sim to anyone. Save your money.
__label__2 Awesome product..must have: I must honestly say this product is very absorbent better thank anything I ever tried I would definitely recommend this item,,,I am a critic but this guzzler works you won't regret and the custome service is on point...I must say they take there product and services into consideration ...and what customers think of them...kudos
__label__2 AWESOME SWING: I SO LOVE THIS SWING! MY 16 YEAR OLD SON STAINED AND SEALED IT AFTER MY HUSBAND PUT IT TOGETHER. THE HUSBAND HUNG IT AT THE WRONG ANGLE, SO WHEN HE WENT OUT OF TOWN, I FIXED THE ANGLE MYSELF...LOVE IT. YOU WILL TOO. JUST BE SURE TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE OF THE ANGLE BEFORE YOU HANG IT. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT CLEAR ON THIS MATTER.
__label__1 Poor content. Not for flowershop owners: If you are a flowershop owner and searching for a variety of fresh ideas for your clients this is not the appropiate book. It has a few nice photos but they are scarce. Definitely not worth it.
__label__2 Better than Country Boy Records: Man , this Raiheim CD , is way better than anything Thugged Out's ever came out with (plus better than Contry Boy, although he disses them throughout the CD), especially now that they are nation wide with their new Distribution deal w/ Orchard. I havent bought it yet but I listened to it , and if you havent you need to.
__label__1 It is okay: It was not as I expected. It is okay, dont' think I would of bought it had I known what it was really like, but it is okay.
__label__2 Brilliant work...: If you are interested in deepening in Israel archaeology then this encyclopedia it is highly recommended, however there is a 5th volume with more up dates that you should probably get through the publishers...
__label__1 WHO TAUGHT THIS DUMB ASS HOW TO TYPE!!!!!!: The author of this book Michael Lane must have been taught how to spell by his son. this stupid son of a bitch mispelled every word in the book. I can understand why he is so dumb mostly because he is crippled, but the fact the books sounds like it was made by the power rangers makes me think this guy is the next michael jackson. in all if you buy this book you are aiding terrorism, and if you read it you are just making yourself that much dumber. SO PLEASE DON'T BUY AND READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I know the truth about BRETT FARVE FANATIC!: This BrettFavrefanatic is none other than the sick son of a bitch author Michael Lane. He has ruined his credibility because he has been charged with 18 accounts of child molestation and tells about his accounts of raping the kids in his book. Do not read this book FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY!!
__label__2 I LOVED IT.: Lynn Johnston is my favorite comic strip writer/artist, and FBOW is my favorite comic strip. Highlights of this edition include Michael's graduation,Gordon and Tracey's engagement and the death of Farley,which is truly moving.
__label__2 Great book!: I probably pronounced every name in this book incorrectly but the kids still love it! Great for pre-k to younger elementary children, the book is a perfect way to introduce the Savannah habitat and get some counting practice in as well.
__label__2 Highly recommended: An extremely humorous, and yet truthful book. Not only does Zahavi accurately portray the female psyche, but also helps express the feelings, and emotions of anyone who has ever been pushed too far, and has finally said - enough is enough ...
__label__2 Very awesome product: Love how soft this makes the skin feel, it is sticky but then just absorbs nicely into skin. I use regularly.
__label__1 Messy!: I didn't even use this product long enough to see if it even worked b/c the graphics on the bottle come off if you get even the smallest amount of oil on it and it gets all over EVERYTHING. Was not worth using again after all the mess.
__label__2 Well organized presentation with detailed information: The New Rose Expert divides roses by hybrid tea, floribunda, patio, miniature, ground cover, climber & rambler and shrub with small labels at the bottom of each category for quick location and each rose is presented with beautiful photo, general description, and the specifics: blooms, foiliage, health, and awards for efficient comparisons. In depth coverage of planting, care and propagation with pointers for the novus are included. I especially liked the guides to selection of roses depending on the fragrance, color and proposed use (ground cover, climber, etc). An excellent primer!
__label__2 lOADED with information: I am just beginning to grow roses and have read many books. This has it all and I like the format.
__label__1 Not a good Disney movie: I usually like Disney movies. They are simple, colorful, delivers a good message and it is mindless TV for about an hour and a half. When I started watching Cow Girls, this is what I was expecting. The movie is about two girls who have to work at their father's dairy company and must soon save the company when things start to go wrong. The movie was awful; it had bad acting, bad, super super bad dialogue, cliché scenes (but to the extreme) and it was just bad in general. Did anyone bother to call the police when the guy stole the money?!My major issue with the movie is the dialogue, it was pathetic. Alyson and Amanda Michalka are not amazing actresses, but they are not that horrible. But, the script in this movie makes their acting horrible. I'd rather watchZenon: Girl of 21st Century,Cadet KellyorHigh School Musical (Two-Disc Remix Edition). This movie was really bad and I was appalled that it made it to the TV screen.
__label__1 Not one of their best DVDs: I was a bit disappointed with this new release. The beach background and the music were distracting and the exercises were not as well designed as in their other DVDs. I am a fan of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh. A month after I started the Fat Free Yoga DVD, I withdrew my gym membership and did yoga only. I own several of their DVDs and I rotate them in the course of a week. Overall, I feel healthier, happier, sleep better, and I even like myself better. My favorite DVDs are Lose Weight & Feel Great, Yoga Beauty Body, and Yoga Cleanse.
__label__2 My favorite of the new trio!: Ana and Ravi's Stretch, Strengthen and Be Stress Free is my favorite of their new trio. I am an advanced beginner exerciser and I do a full hour of this whenever I use it, which is often. I find it feels wonderful on my back, especially since I have a tendency to tighten up there or strain it a bit when doing other workouts. I also love the hip opening sequence. This DVD has, in my opinion, the best back and leg stretches of any of their workouts.Since using Raviana's tapes, I have lost 12+ pounds and am on my way to a new body!Another thing I love about this tape - and their others - is that there is no endless sequence of Sun Salutations. The moves are unique but focused, and I never look at the clock while doing these!
__label__2 An Awesome Recording: I saw Jim Black perform some years ago with sax-player Assif Tsahar and violinist Mat Maneri, and he absolutely blew me away. When I found out that he had his own band I immediately rushed out to get this CD, and I wasn't disappointed. While it obviously owes a great deal to free jazz, that's only one point of departure. If you could imagine free jazz spiced with ambient, heavy metal, Morphine and "Moving Pictures"-era Rush, it would probably sound something like this.
__label__2 Great Details!: Love all the extras in this book. Some of the information is not as up to date as I would like or are not always backed by scientific evidence (seems like a "must" to me in a high school biology book!)For example, "the day has come when we are now able to produce new living things" you have seen this on TV. Since when does TV become solid evidence to support a statement!) I prefer true scientific studies that have used the scientific method to come to their conclusions. This is getting picky, because I appreciate the drawings, photos, extra study hints (especially in the teacher's edition) and the web pages that are suggested- done by Prentice-Hall.
__label__2 Another excellent track from Rage: This track totally kix ***! Rage is the real thing, Kid Rock, Korn, Limp Bizkit are *** compared to rage. Tom's at it again with an amazing solo, it sounds like a harmonica which gives the song a wierd feel to it. If you ask me that solo sounds like some techno square dancing tune, either way the track is awesome. This single will make you say turn that *** up!!
__label__2 This song rocks! Rage has come back strong and hard.: You need to listen to this song. The new album, The Battle of Los Angeles, comes to stores November 2, 1999.
__label__2 They've delivered once again!: This song is really fantastic and is one of their better songs already. This song REALLY gets me psyched for their new CD. I mean, when I first heard "The Ghost of Tom Joad" on the video, I knew they were still writing great material, and another great song like this proves they haven't lost any of their energy! Could "The Battle of Los Angeles" be the rightful heir to the self-titled Rage CD ?(Don't get me wrong, I love Evil Empire, but compared to the first one...) With two great songs recently written by them, one of which is on the new CD, my hopes are high!
__label__2 History made entertaining: It was the showtime series on the Borgia's that got me interested in this book. I found the information to be enlightening. When I was a youth, I found history boring. It was decades later before I found books that were not dry, that gave a clear view of life during the period of time being reviewed. Gregorovius does a good job of making this a very readable piece of history. It's full of unbiased information from validated sources. Truth is more interesting and sometimes stranger than fiction. It gave me an entirely different view of Lucretia Borgia from the view I had developed watching the popular series on TV. Worth the read.
__label__1 Bad Grammar, Bad info, Bad book: This book is the epitome of what a sports book shouldn't be. Mythical stats are surrounded by poor grammar that's hard to read and follow. The highlight of the book is truly it's first chapter on the first game ever. Unfortunately, the book goes down from there.
__label__2 Professor as Madonna, or Madonna as Professor?: Professora Paglia is interesting! A lesbian who likes sex with men. A former (?) Catholic so steeped in the puritanism that she lambasts that she has trouble with sex. She predates the Sokal hoax in attacking the nonsense called poststructuralism and other hardly-baked "ideas" of postmodernism. She deserves credit for that. Without PC, in the form of the sexual harrassment laws, Mr. Starr would have remained only the boring, unknown, fundamentalist lawyer that he really is. One irritating point: her (philosophic) idea that every raped woman should enjoy the rape just a bit: that wild notion probably was not derived from experiment! But that's the trouble with most of philosophy. It's just that: mere philosophy.
__label__2 bally blast: I bought this product because I was drinking a lot of coffee during the day, and that was starting to give me head aches... plus I hate yellow teeth and after a while dark drinks (such as coffee) tend to discolor my pearly whites, so I wanted something that would help me not want to go to sleep in the middle of the day... Before I tried caffeine pills... i cant remember which ones exactly it was about a year ago, but I do remember the coating was sweet and I did not like that at all, but anyways... those made me really jittery and after they wore off I would crash again and be soooo tired, but after taking Blast for a few days I have noticed a pleasant energy boost that doesnt make me feel all "hyped up" and jittery... I'm just not tired, and that is very nice.
__label__2 Sevendust- Sevendust: I have all the books -- they're all the same as any other guitar book. Except these guys rock. See if you can get the intro to Black down, it's sooooo cool when you do; people are so amazed when you pull that out of the bag of tricks.Best song...Speak!!!
__label__1 I thought high tech at first.: The only thing this is good for is to use as a shimmy. Can I get my money back please?
__label__2 Beautiful music to be savored: I am too far over the hill to use this for seduction as another reviewer suggests, but I can appreciate every track in this wonderful compilation for what they are: music played from and for the soul and heart.Everyone is going to have a favorite track or tracks - tastes vary. For me it's "I Can't Get Started" performed by Lester Young with the Nat King Cole Trio (in fact, my search for that song led me here). How High the Moon is another track that grabs me, but honestly, every track on this album is a winner.If you love great music, and especially if you love listening to sensual music that is greatly enhanced during the wee hours (with or without a companion) this album will bring a lot of pleasure. Listen to the track samples, then buy it!
__label__1 not good: not what is looked like...and not what i wanted. I was expecing something different and now i cant return it cuz it will cost more to return it then i actually spent on it
__label__1 Healer or Dennis Miller ?: As a medical practitioner who uses alternative healing methods I am an advocate of Caroline's approach, however this work is not very helpful. Despite the title, it is oriented ONLY toward psychic healers, and she rants excessively and it seems illogically at various sacred cows.
__label__1 Myss should be in films...: Myss should be in films...because all she ever does is project her own insecurities on to her audience. I get the feeling that if something happened to her that she didn't like she'll talk about it in her lecture, make the other person wrong to make her feel better about herself. She could really use a little vegetarianism or meditation, two practices seh seems to think that she is above.
__label__1 This book is really just a long ad for the IBS treatment center: This book is really just a long ad for the IBS treatment center. It has some good basic info, but all that info could have been summed up in about 10 pages. I went to the IBS treatment center web site. It is listed on every page of the book The web site sells probiotics that are much more expensive than anything else I have seen. They also offer medical services if you go to their center.I don't know anything about the IBS treatment center. Maybe it is a good place. If you want to buy a long advertisement in book form, you might like this book.
__label__1 Cheap and wrong size!: The description said 6 x 8 frame, which to me means it holds a 6 x 8 picture!!! No, these nimrods meant the measurement of the whole frame end to end on the outside. WTF? It is crappy cheap plastic too. Totally not happy. Booooooo!!!!
__label__1 Doesn't have feel of a good soccer ball: This ball's shell is altogether too hard for a quality soccer ball, and it feels too heavy. I'm returning mine.
__label__1 Not all natural: I thought about getting this product but then I found out that it contains mineral oil and white petrolatum - both are petroleum derived ingredients. Better, and safer, options would be Badger diaper cream or Burt's Bees Baby Bee diaper ointment which do not contain nasty synthetic chemicals.
__label__2 Beautiful harmony!: What a blessing to have this CD available. I bought several for gifts. The harmony and blending of voices is wonderful. It does my heart good. Thank you!
__label__1 Not a durable paddle: This paddle has a very limited durability. After purchasing two paddles, both ended up snapping off where the handle meets the rubber.
__label__1 Doesnt work as advertised: This is a cute toy, I will give them that. And I didnt realize until much later that it played music. But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING. We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too. It collapses on everything, it falls on her. We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things. We could have done that with toys she already had. This was a waste of money.
__label__1 disappointed: I looked forward to the release of Ana and Ravi's new titles very much, but have to say I am disappointed.The workout is still a good one, but like what another reviewer had said, the background was very distracting and so was the inconsistent and roving camera. I also found the music too loud and the pace too fast.
__label__2 NEW ENGLAND ONLY is the focus: This is a compendium of New England horrors from past articles in 'Yankee' magazine....a little dry, but not a bad coffee table book if it is in good condition. Me, I got mine new some thirty plus years ago.It has good things on little known horrors such as the Worcester Tornado, lighthouse capsizings, gales, the Boston Molasses Flood, etc.
__label__1 don't buy for your kids...: Ham once again is teaching his extrabiblical teachings to our kids. Instead of teaching scripture, he is trying to profit from the new interest in dinosaurs for the benefit of his radical group. We need books that show real biblical teachings about science, not ones like this.
__label__1 Not sure about this: I find these cards very difficult to use. Shuffling is impossible and and the instructions vague. That said, I still like and am intriqed buy the idea of these cards. I believe that you can change your thoughts and change your life (Dr. Wayne Dyer). I am still wiling to give the cards a chance.
__label__2 So cute: My son loves it. My complaint is that it lasted about 8 months. I thought the battery died, but the whole engine did. Once dead, it's pretty useless because you can't push it on the tracks.Just bought a replacement.
__label__1 Blurry pictures: We bought this camera so we could take pictures while on land based excursions from a cruise ship. We had booked beach and kayak excursions and I didn't want to risk my camera to the water adventures. The price was right and I didn't really want to spend the amount needed to protect my Nikon from water as I figured only to take 20 or so pictures and probably never use the case again.The camera did and excellent job of taking pictures, but due to the protective case used to protect it from water, almost all my photos came out blurry. I'm sure that's due to the fact that the case is molded plastic. The camera outside of the case is fine for a simple 35MM.
__label__2 Herencia: I recommend this for persons interested in learning the culture and advancing their learning of Spanish; it proceeds at an easy to follow pace.
__label__2 Helpful guide but not for the beginner: I've read a number of books on FengShui, and found this book beautifully illustrated. It offered many details about the background and different types of feng shui methods, which while informative could be very confusing to a beginner. I agree with the other reviewers that although it was reader friendly, it offered few or too brief solutions and the possible need for another book. Perhaps her smaller books would be good companions to this one. Just-A-Note: At the same time I bought this, I also ordered CREATING SACRED SPACE with FENG SHUI, Learning the Art of Space Clearing by KAREN KINGSTON. After reading both books, I consider SACRED SPACE to be a must have, a book that should always be the first feng shui book anyone reads. It can change your life.
__label__2 Jolly, quirky historical fiction: Frances Trollope, famous in the 1800s for her book attacking the United States, ostensibly wrote this as a biography of her equally famous friend Fanny Wright, the radical and feminist. The story of her friend meanders through the pathways of Mrs Trollope's own life and adventures, which often take center stage in this jolly and edging-toward-doddering narrative. In this story of two now-forgotten women, we experience the struggles of living in the 1800s and the burgeoning nation of America, and it is all rather delightful, but Edmund White includes more. Through the veil of historical fiction, White contemplates gender inequality, American politics and culture, racial distinctions, and religion, and allows the readers to draw parallels to modern day. "Fanny: A Fiction" is a conversational, quirky novel that may surprise some readers.
__label__1 pulp: as bad ass as this sounds this is the biggest tease,....dont spend money on buying this item cause i dosent even work...or find out the hard way..............sincerly isaac coustemer since 2002pulp fan since 1998.............
__label__2 Wonderful meditation enhancement!: I've used many types of music over the years with my meditation. No matter how beautiful, the thing that has always bothered me is the fact that music creates a certain distraction factor. The melody, no matter how soft or subtle, makes me focus on it rather than my meditation (external focus vs. internal).This CD has changed that. It is wonderful and relaxing to listen to, but it has no true melody to create distraction. It is haunting, with a harmonic resonance that pulls me into a deep meditation unlike what I can typically achieve.
__label__2 A Great Book!!!!: With all the bad reviews,You might think this book is not good!!!But it don't!!! I LOVE FEAR STREET books and this is one of the best!!!It's way better then most of them!!!!read this book!!!I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Junk: Recieved this item in poor packaging (would you believe in a priority mail envelope?) I did not recieve the information I needed to make it work. My father worked 5 hours on this item, I chose Linksys because it sounded like adurable product.I tried to talk to the Amazon client but all he/she was concerned about was he/her rating and he/her would not answer any of my questions.It felt generic and then creepy and then it started to feel like harrassment. I reported them to Amazon and they stopped bothering me about the item.I ended up going to walmart and buying an expensive wireless modem at this point was through chasing cats. Works well.
__label__2 Great overview of various tarantulas!: I agree with the review of Tom Kavanaugh. I have uploaded some images of the cover and table of contents; which has a list of all the species covered. If you can't read the images go to my image gallery and you'll be able to see them there.
__label__1 Blech!: This is not a condemnation of the movie itself which is fantastic. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD is 16:9 and it is not, it's 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire screen or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player.
__label__2 80 years after...: 80 years after, we know a voyage thru the Tibet, Chine and Mongolia for the eyes and the pen of a young lady. A different land and people, a great aventure, great images, someones hand-coloured.
__label__1 4 Stars when it works - Mine only last 15 months: I had a Samsung LTM225W for 15 months and then it just went bad. (I replaced the power convertor to no avail). I'm now dealing with Samsung's extremely poor 12 month warranty offering. I've had TV last 20 years on me and now the most expensive TV I've ever bought didn't last 2 years! I'm very frustrated. If you buy Samsung products, consider getting an extended warranty plan since Samsung doesn't stand very firmly behind their products.
__label__2 One of his best, mix of sharp words on gentle music (german): He is like red wine, geting better and better over the years. No music for the background, you have to listen careful to the words.
__label__2 Helps with acne...: I normally use a 2% salicylic acid lotion for my acne. It doesn't completely solve my problem though so I've been looking for something stronger. This stuff is not exactly made for acne, but it is the same ingredient as my acne medicine except in a 3% concentration instead of 2%, so I thought I'd give it a try. One thing I like about it is that it has very few other ingredients (all of which are non-comedogenic), so I don't have to worry about the non-active ingredients causing me problems. It is slightly drying and has caused minor flaking, but nothing too major. I only use it at night though (and my regular 2% stuff during the day) because it doesn't work under make-up. It dries leaving an almost rubber-like coating on my skin, so when I try to apply make-up on top, the gel rubs off in a rubbery layer. It has made a minor improvement in my acne, but not as much as I'd hoped.
__label__2 It's a vacuum belt.: This is a good vacuum belt. It's also easy to replace. I only wish they lasted a bit longer, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. If you have tall carpet or simply happen to vacuum a lot, the belts can wear down fairly fast (after about 6 months, which is faster than I'd like). The down side is that they are expensive, but other than that, they're great.
__label__1 Too much Humanities: It focus too much in Humanities and its skills. It basically translates academia skills into teaching, and talk too much how useful teaching can be in other jobs. In science there is research without teaching, and there are probably (I hope) other skills that can be useful in non-academic jobs. I was looking for this kind of information or hints. It is true it gives some "tools" how to break your own research activities into more detailed "actions" (not really into skills), but still does not tell me which ones are interesting in non-academic jobs.
__label__1 Questionable and Off-Target: I read this as a middle-school student as part of a faith-based curriculum, and I largely feel that it is off-target and questionable in terms of its historical accuracy. Considering that modern society has defined ``truth'' in terms of that which is attainable by the scientific method, the title of the book ``When Science Fails'' is largely a contradiction: The questionable historical accounts given in the book could better be considered examples of ``When Humans Fail'' rather than profound criticisms of the scientific method itself.Read this book if: You do not understand the scientific method; you do not want to understand the scientific method; and you want to read historical allegories of why it is wrong.Do not read this book if: You value your time or money.
__label__1 Good Singing And Playing?: Here Grand Funk do neither, but one can only expect so much from a second string hard rock band of the seventies, Boston, they ain't. Needless to say, this is the most inaptly named album of all time. The band, which is neither Grand nor Funky, is likewise ineptly described.
__label__1 Poor Graphics: This is a 10 year throwback in graphics quality. Suitable for a 10 year old computer but not today's modern computers. Game is OK if you want to practice Blackjack but ancient in its graphic display.
__label__2 Shun Steel 8-inch Offset Bread: Good bread slicer. I like the way it slices softer bread and rolls with very little pressure that would squash the item with other knives I have on hand. Couple this with the Shun U2 sandwich knife.
__label__2 Far Side is incredible: I hardly think I need to explain why this book deserves 5 stars. Gary Larson is a genius and his one frame comics will have you laughing out loud again and again. If you're a fan of the Far Side, you will love this. If you're new to the Far Side, BUY THIS BOOK. It is incredible
__label__1 misleading: The add shows a kit but when they send it to you all you get is the book. The book is great but when I bought it I expected to get the whole kit.
__label__2 Catchy tunes!: As usual, once you hear the YGG music, you will be singing along and trying to learn all of the dance moves.
__label__1 No DVD!! The case was shrink wrapped and opened for a christmas gift with no dvd inside!: No DVD!! The case was shrink wrapped and opened for a christmas gift with no dvd inside! Very disappointed 3 year old.
__label__1 A one-joke concept that grows thin quickly: It's just not funny. Musically, there's nothing interesting going on. The sly wink of doing the punk cover of a mainstream pop song has rarely been used to good effect, and an entire album of them from a band that does nothing but is pandering to the sniggering punk kids of the worst kind.
__label__2 love it: Great educational video for preschool - first grade students. My son is currently in kindergarten and he just love these videos, which as helped him in his spelling words for school
__label__1 Not As Many as it seems: I was a bit disappointed with this volume. Probably should have paid more attention to the description. I assumed that there would be an exploded view of each gun I own-and wanted to buy. This would then serve as "do all" reference for componentry. Not quite--lot's of drawings but not some of the more common Taurus revolvers among others. Some of the drawings are also a bit difficult to see/read numbers part shapes etc..Not a bad investment-just not a great investment. Excellent paperweight!!
__label__1 Simplistic Waste of Time: This book was preachy, simplistic, boring and not helpful. It was neither motivational nor informative but it was a waste of money and my time.
__label__1 Don't waste your time or money: First this is not the original line up,far from it.Second it has WAY more pressing's than 200 or 300 and it's not a offical release from the band.I'm huge fan and I have one word for this.....CRAP!
__label__2 Pretty good; bottom more difficult than top: I've used them for the full 5 days, and they really do whiten your teeth. They are much thicker than the other brand that are a little slimy around your teeth. The strips are more of a wax like substance that takes a little while to mold to your teeth, so some firm pressing and holding / molding works. I find the upper strips get easier to work in than the bottom strips, and I even broke one of the bottom strips taking it out of the package! Otherwise, they work well for the short period they are in your mouth.
__label__2 Best product in its category.: Out of all of the whitening products I have tried, this product is the most user friendly. Nearly all of the "strips" on the market have the same levels of peroxide for whitening; the true product differentiatior is the usability of the product. This product conforms to teeth very securely, covers all areas, and does not loose its adhesiveness after 1.5 hours (as long as I have tested).
__label__2 1st Person Narrative Really Gets You In Evan's Head: I really enjoyed the 1st person narrative that the author uses to tell his story. A "coming of age" novel in which gay men can relate. Evan longs for love while finding only sex. The sex satisfies his hormones, yet he wants more... he wants normalcy. There's a clear under current hear that his orientation has developed from his enstranged relationship with his father. The characters are well drawn. Some of Evan's fantasies are hard to grasp and relate with in context to the story line. All in all, beautifully written.
__label__1 Not a true solution: I didn't find this method any different than the cry it out method. After all, you are just leaving your baby to cry in his crib...though the authors suggest only allowing so for an hour at naptime. Well, after an hour of sobbing uncontrollably, my baby could NOT get to sleep, and I was heartbroken that I even attempted this. There are gentler ways to help your baby sleep.
__label__2 Be an un-rude (not necessarily polite) Gaijin: If you are Japanese, this book will show you (1) how Americans who seem rude to you might actually be trying to be polite; and (2) how you can tailor your politeness to American ears.If you are American (or Western, in general), this book will teach you how to interpret as acts of politeness some seemingly quirky Japanese customs. However, if you want to learn how to be polite in Japan (rather than just un-rude), this book might well come up short.A rather short read, this book's coverage of Japanese-American misunderstandings is mostly anecdotal. Also, because the book is over 20 years old, it does not peer into the rather different minds of Japan's younger generations.
__label__2 Stylish and practical nursing top: love the front flap design of the Japanese Weekend D&A tops. Easy access and offers a lot of coverage. I own several of these styles. I do not need to use additional coverups when nursing in public, in fact. This particular top is a favorite as it is quite versatile. I wear it to work with black pants, add a jacket for meetings and pair it with jeans or yoga pants on the weekends. Plus, it is machine washable and does not need ironing. What else can a new mother ask for?
__label__2 Excellent: My daughter loves this series then got me hooked, too. Shocking, Funny, Intriguing, and romantic. Great music, too, which is always a plus. If you like One Tree Hill, I think you'll like this, too.
__label__2 Vampire Diairies: I like this series very much. It's very entertaining! I do believe that it is for the younger generation of today but I still enjoyed it immensely
__label__2 TVD S1: My only nitpick with the dvd is that there are no commentaries from the cast. I hope they remedy that with S2. I LOVE the show so there's nothing much else to say.
__label__2 great: I recieved this within 3 business days. The price was great. It is in great condition. I could not wait for them to come any faster.
__label__2 Vampire Diaries: season 1:: I like the show but again like the twilight saga why do they have to change the books when they take it to tv or make a movie out of it. I mean Elena has a little sister in the books not a teenage brother on drugs and where is her bestfriend Meredith? I like the show but it would be better if made more like the books
__label__1 Eye-candy for the simple minded: If you are a white teen female, love romances, and never want to emerge from your cutesy world....This is for you!
__label__1 Wasn't Impressed: I was not impressed with the pilot and probably will not watch again. It just wasn't entertaining as True Blood or Twilight. I think maybe we have enough different vampire shows to keep us entertained that we do not need another.
__label__2 What I've Read: I have read that the Season 1 DVD will be released on 8/31/10 & the 2nd season will start early September. No exact date. And I've also read that they are considering making a soundtrack of the show. I'm so hooked on this show.
__label__1 Vampires 90210: I tried. I really did try to like this show. But after a certain amount of stereotypical vamp-angst, teen drama, and bad acting, I finally quit. I gave it a fair chance--I think I quit 4 or 5 episodes in--but I just couldn't stand the level of the actors and even the script. The plot is okay, I suppose. If you're really into high school (or IN high school) and really into vampires... go ahead.
__label__2 great collection!: If you're a huge Vampire Diaries fan like me, you'll appreciate this collection and the series in HD. I only gave it one less star from perfect though because my Disc 2 skips during the Caroline/Damon bedroom fight. Other than that, I'm pleased with the content and love how well-written the series is when you put all episodes sequentially!Mind you, I'm also someone who thinks True Blood's storyline is lame and the Twilight saga is definitely too 'teen-ish'. This series falls just in between of both and it helps that Kevin Williamson is one of the involved writers/producers!
__label__2 good case: This is a good case for my new Sony camera, though the value for money aspect kept me from giving it a perfect score of five stars.The fit for the camera is snug, and it manages to provide the camera's body with adequate protection without being bulky. It also resists scratches -- I've used mine for several weeks and have already traveled with it a great deal, and it still looks new (and thanks to the case, so does the camera). It even comes with a variety of carrying straps, assuring that at least one will suit your needs. It is obvious that a great deal of thought went into the case, just as it did the camera.
__label__2 Great table: This table is easy to put together and just what we were looking for. Comes with all hardware -- just add the wood of your choosing. Note that the instructions are printed on the box (no paper instructions inside), so don't rip up or throw away the box before you read the instructions. Good product.Update (6/6/2012: It's been a little over 5 years since I bought this and posted this review in May of 2007, and this table and benches are still working beautifully, with only some sanding and painting of the wood. Definitely a good value.
__label__1 Incorrect Item: I orderd one item and received something else. This item was needed for an on-line class and due to the error I am behind schedule on my class work.
__label__1 defective--only two front wheels are turning: Our battery operated James is defective. At first we thought that this train is different built than our other battery operated train Salty and therefore weaker. Salty operates almost perfectly, chugs up the hills and takes the turns, whereas James could not go up hills and could not pull wagons, and overall seemed much slower than Salty. Upon closer inspection and comparison with Salty (after return period was already over), we discovered that for Salty 4 wheels are powering the movement (eg., battery makes two front wheels and two back wheels turn), whereas for our James only two front wheels are turning. Of course, it makes sense that this way James cannot move as fast and as well as Salty. So our James is defective...hoping that we can exchange it.
__label__1 Derails: We have Battery Operated Thomas and Battery Operated James. Other than the color they look very similar, and, I suspect, use the same mechanics. Unfortunately, James derails very often on the same tracks that Thomas has no problem navigating. I have two tracks: a coal sifter figure 8 and the oval starter kit from Target. James derailes on each one of the tracks separately as well as on the layout I created by combining the two sets. Sometimes it'd go around fine one time and then derail on the second run - very strange. Battery Operated Thomas almost never derails.On the positive side, my two-year old son loves these trains.
__label__1 If it worked consistently it would be amazing: As soon as the batteries were in my son was not interested in opening or looking at any other Christmas gifts. Sadly, it stopped working within the first hour of playing. My dad was able to jostle it back to life a few times and we changed the battery once and it worked again for about 10 minutes. Now it is completely dead. And its wheels don't work like the regular trains so my son can't use it manually either. We absolutely have to return it. I have read that the battery powered Thomas works better, so we will try to exchange it for that one. It had no problems staying on our imaginarium tracks, pulling cars or going up hills when it was working. If it worked consistently it would be the perfect toy. For $30 it should be more reliable. It is NOT a "very useful engine."
__label__1 Does not stay on curved track.: This engine is cute and seems to be well constructed. It does a good job of going up ramps, is easy to turn on and off, and takes a single battery. However, it kept running off any curves in the train track. We decided to return it and look for something that will stay on our son's track.
__label__2 This Gyro is an excellent classic toy: This Gyroscope is the high Quality Toy that used to be purchased at the local mall or the educational store. Now they have become hard to find. This Gyro is durable and comes with the string and the rip cord to start it with. It is an excellent tool for explaining motion and the physics behind the force that balances. I highly recommend this toy.
__label__1 extremely UNINFORMED!: In my opinion this book makes it look like SOMEONE didn't do very much research! Quite frankly, I hope that Ruth Brown Never writes another book that bashes any religion, like this book did! If you're buying this book to get a honest veiw of modern witch craft then you are going to be VERY disappointed. Like just about everyone on this page of reveiws has said, This book is just causing more ignorence and hate.
__label__2 If you are a Link Wray Fan!: I just bought this CD and it's really great! John is still as good as ever and plays his guitar as the hot artist he is. If you get into real rock stuff then dont miss this one! I saw John play with Mick Fleetwood and Anton Fig together on stage and it was really cool. Good luck John on this CD and we hope you will do another one soon!
__label__1 Disappointing: I thought that this would be gummy. I had some sticky putty like substance that was this size and came in a roll. I used it for flower arrangements and helping candles stand up in their holders. This was basically white paper. It held nothing and was useless. The postage to send it back was more than the cost. So it's just sitting in a drawer waiting to find a use for it.
__label__2 This is a great book for beginners!: I loved the recipes and nutritional information. There is even a list of manufacturers in the back of the book.
__label__2 The Nader Reader: Ralph Nader brought up many important issues in this year's presidential race. Many of these are seen throughout the writings in this book and it is apparent that the problems he talks about are not recent, nor are they going to go away without any massive efforts.Nader's style is a little dry and difficult to read at times, but the points he brings up (especially in the sections on the presidency, democracy, and grassroots organizing) are vital to the progressive movement. His sections on tort reform and law practice are a little more technical and are probably best understood by those in the field.Nader has stood by his convictions from the time he started fighting GM to today. This is an excellent book that traces his numerous crusades throughout the decades and gives a boost to the future.
__label__1 Written for the Intellectual Elite and Not the Average Reader: Ralph Nader has been around for some time and has had his day.He claims to be a populist, caliming to be for the people. However, when you read his books, you can see that he is really writing for the sake of the intellectual elite. He does not write to acoomodate average readers thus failing to get his point through to them. Well, so much for being a populist and a man of the people.Nader just does a lot of talking and writing and accomplishes nothing.In the presidential election, all he succeeded in doing was drawing votes away from Al Gore allowing George W. Bush to win the election giving us eight more years of Reagan-Bush policies which have ultimately led us to this financil disaster on Wall Street and all over the United States.
__label__1 Loquacious and another world: For a person living and working in the British Isles, 'Teach Yourself Copywriting' by J. Jonathan Gabay may be a fine read. But I don't live there. Residency aside, I found this book to be overly wordy to the point of feeling like I was slogging through swamps of verbiage to find a useful morsel. And there are useful bits there, it's just that it boarders on not being worth the time and effort to get to them. Someone interested in the topic of copywriting would do better to read similar books by Robert Bly or Peter Bowerman, both much more interesting and succinct; my apologies to Brits everywhere.
__label__2 Better than you realize: Like most, I was expecting(hoping) for something that hit me between the eyes as a classic(When doves Cry, Sign O' the times). And in that respect, I was disappointed. But being a fan, I forced myself to listen again without the expectations, as most non-fans will hear the song. And what I heard was a beautiful melody, a chorus that implants itself in your head, subtle guitar underscoring the singing, and harmonies that send chills. Yeah, it's commercial, but it's far, far better than most of the bland stuff I'm hearing on the radio. And nobody out there could sing a song like this the way he can.
__label__2 This is my first PDA/Organizer: I purchased this about 4 months ago and it really is easy to use especially if you are familiar with Microsoft Word and Excel. I use it to copy files from my PC that I want to have handy. The only thing I wish it had is a backlight. But that hasn't come into play too often. I usually have to charge it every 2 or 3 days. I recommend this product if you are not worried about having a lot accessories to go with it, because they are not that many available.
__label__1 Piece of Crap: I have ordered thousands of items in my lifetime, and bar none, this is the biggest piece of crap I have ever received. It is supposed to come completely put together, but when it arrived, there were no less than 10 little parts that had come off the screen assembly and one screen that was loose and all of its parts dangling. The first thing that happenned is that I cut myself on one of the screens because the protective side had come off. I was bleeding for quite some time. The second thing I noticed was the extremely poor quality of the material and assembly. I am very handy by nature, but even I had to give up trying to put this piece of junk back together again. Plus it was not worth it, even if I had put it together again, all I would have then had was a piece of crap fireplace screen.
__label__1 Okay at first, but died pretty quickly...: My parents ordered me these new speakers when they got me a new monitor. For awhile, they did work fine, and the sound quality was great. However, the other day, they randomly died on me after about 3 months' use. I'm stuck trying to find another relatively inexpensive set of speakers (while still giving the audio quality I'm looking for).
__label__2 Great Little Speakers for Music: I like to listen to internet radio and CDs while I work. Not listening too loudly, though I have been known to turn it up for the occasional song now and then. For my use and for the price, these are great speakers: not tinny, decent bass.
__label__2 Great Bench Kit!: I made a small (24" long) warming bench for sitting next to our new Tilikivi fireplace using cherry 2 x 4's finished with rubbing lacquer. The 2 x 4 Basic bench ends are very sturdy and attractive. The green color is nice, but I sprayed them flat black with all purpose paint to match our other fireplace accessories. High quality product.
__label__1 Neil Armstrong, A Good Man: Neil, A Good Man. Too bad he didn't land or walk on the moon.He was presented with a Deal he couldn't refuse. He didn't wantto end up like Grissom, White and Chaffee. So, he went along withthe program.Too bad this book is a book of fiction. No way there was a moon landingwhere men walked on the moon. Too bad James R. Hansen can't stand someonesaying something negative about his book.
__label__2 Works great!!: I purchased the item hoping that it would fit my Ridgid planner, which I purchased used and was about 8 years old.First I put through a piece of 2 X 6 without the collector on, what a giant mess! I put on the collector andI was stunned! 97% of all he wood shavings were sucked up. You can use the 4" port or 2 1/2" port.Buy this item, it will save you tons of time cleaning up
__label__1 Huh? The CD's over? Best nap I ever took.: Ferry, Ferry, Ferry. WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? I can't believe that you mixed half of this crap. Frist off besides being boring, this complation is the same trance cd with the same songs that everyone else is putting out. With the likes of a genious such as Ferry Corsten, I expected something more. There are only a handful of songs that redeemed this cd. I'm not saying that the songs on it are bad, but rather old and played out. If I have to hear Bt's Dreaming on one more CD this year, I'm gonna shoot myself! If you truly like your trance to make you get up and dance, check Ferry's earlier work on the MOS series or check out any of the Euphoria cd's or Dj Tiesto. If you have a hard time going to sleep, this is the cd for you.
__label__2 The Celtic Knotwork Handbook, a perfect book for beginers: If you are just getting started, or have been interested in knotwork for a while, this is a great book! It provides historical information, diagrams, how to make circular knots, anamorphics, and more than 100 original knots, which include corners, borders, and motifs. This is the best keltic knot book I've seen.
__label__2 We love Mr. Putter and Tabby!: My children, ages three and five, adore Mr. Puuter and Tabby, and I believe this is Ms. Rylant's funniest rendition of their adventures so far. When the box arrived, I read the book alone because I couldn't stand to wait. Ms. Rylant uses a nice collection of short and medium-length words for beginning readers, and the story rollicks along. Mr. Howard's illustrations capture the subjects' expressions beautifully. We checked these books out of the library so often that we finally ordered some to keep.
__label__1 Not unless you're a time traveler: ... This book is OLD and nigh unto useless unless you frequently travel in time to the first month after MacOS X Server was released. There's a reason why brick-and-mortar stores remove books from shelves and place them on the [bargain] rack. ...
__label__1 not useful anymore: While this book seemed very appealing for someone who is new to Mac OS X server and its Linux underpinnings, it is almost worthless at this point in time since it has not been updated to include the major changes that have been made in the past couple years. Save your money and visit online resources; they are much more valuable.
__label__1 MAC OS X SERVER Administrator's Guide: I was looking for a book that would be a guide to OSX Server since the information included with the software was thin at best. What I found was a text that took the little information that I found in the documentation and puffed it up to over 300 pages with not much more to offer. In all fairness I did pick up some information but it was not worth the price. I'll keep the book on the shelf but it will not be looked at often.
__label__1 Bulb: 10,000 hours; transformer: 250 hours: The bulb is rated for up to 10,000 hours, but the transformer only lasted about 250 hours. The transformer is part of the cord and is not replaceable. Ott-Lite won't respond to my e-mail inquiries and doesn't list transformers as a replacement part. I tried a variety of sources for an 18w. transformer that could be modified to accommodate the lamp, but the cheapest I could find was about $30.00. I bought a brand new Hampton Bay table lamp (similar to the Ott-Lite lamp) at Home Depot for $20.00. If your Ott-Lite ceases to work you'll probably assume that the bulb must be replaced and spend $15.00 or so for a new bulb, only to discover that it's not a bulb problem. So you end up with a lamp that won't work and two bulbs you can't use on any other fixture. Don't buy Ott-Lite products...and exchange any Ott-Lite gifts you might receive.
__label__1 Don't Buy Ott: Buyers, be warned! I bought an Ott Lite a year ago, and was using it for needlework. Then one day, it did not work. I bought a new bulb for it, and it still didn't work. Then I learned about the ballast problems, and join the long line of people that bought from Ott and have expensive lights that no longer work. A beautiful lamp is now done for. I'll never buy another Ott product again. Steer clear!
__label__2 Super.: This item is all I expected and more wooooow no more back ache...Buy if u have a chance and get rid of back ache
__label__2 Extremely Useful for Me and Others: As a teacher and collegiate athletic coach I found "Taming Your Gremlin" and "A Master Class in Gremlin Taming" to be extremely beneficial. Carson's Gremlin Taming method helps me be aware of the barriers I create that limit my potential. By being aware of my own blocks, I am able to help my students and athletes notice theirs as well. We can both then move toward unleashing our fullest potential.While mastering Gremlin Taming is a life-long pursuit, I notice that the Method is easily applicable. It is for this reason I have given "A Master Class" and "Taming Your Gremlin" to All American athletes and Honor students. Often the difference between being good and being great is in their mentality.I strongly suggest "Taming Your Gremlin" and "A Master Class" to any teacher or coach who wishes to help their students or athletes excel.
__label__2 I like this keyboard a lot!: My keyboard at work is so easy to use that I had to find something better for home. This one is actually really good for the price. It's not as flat as the one I have at work (sony vaio) but it is still really easy to use compared to most and it doesn't take up much room on my desk which is nice. I type extremely fast so I was looking for something that would keep up. This one does. The keys are fairly flat and light. I'm glad I bought it.
__label__1 Not for beginners!: There is way too much talking and detailed explanations. If you're looking for a quick yoga exercise, this DVD is not for you.
__label__1 Cheap plasticy looking and can't see the light 3 feet away: Buy this if u have money to spend on junk stuff that you are no going to use. I never knew halogen light was so dull. I dont believe personally that this has a halogen bulb.
__label__2 I really love Puff Daddy and R. Kelly's songs.: I'm so happy they made this song together because having them together makes the song sound tight.It also reminds me of one of my best homegirls, Sheila.
__label__1 Very Disappointed: I expected more about how to create luck, maybe why people feel lucky and how they obtain it, not read pages and pages about luck in the casinos. Nothing really helped me in this book. Explaining others' Gambling and lucky streaks did nothing to help me and in fact bored me. Absolutely no meat to this book. Since I don't gamble, I thought I would scream when more and more pages about gambling began. This book was not what I expected at all. Very disappointed.
__label__1 Strange but, listenable: This is not what I expected. I thought this was an all out rock band and to my dismay I found noise. I can actually sit down and listen to this though. Another review mentioned Merzbow...I think they hit the nail on the head. It has a hint of Meat Beat Manifesto also. I think some of Mike Pattons work also is along this same route.
__label__1 CRAP: this is not music, no matter what anyone says. Its crap! anyone can make these tracks. to write an album like this you need the following: 1. no talent, what so ever. 2. loop a bunch of randomized drum beats, then put distortion on em. 3. have some idiot screaming with heavy distortion and a vocoder in the backround about death. 4. have some low end wet synth bass playing somthing that makes no sence 5. every 20 seconds have some annoying ass distorted ear bleeding noise come in and then cut off real short. 6. dont forget to tie yourslef in to the industrial scene. if you want real talent!? and still want that industrial noise? look up a band called "the lack" they kill!
__label__2 Obey the warning: This is a fun toy and my 2 and 6 year olds love it. However, there is a very hard to read warning on the underside of the train that says that hair may become tangled in wheels. They are not kidding! I had to cut that train out of my two year olds hair when he picked it up off the track and lifted it too close to his head. It happened in an instant! It was a bit traumatic for both of us. Fun toy, but can be dangerous.
__label__1 Unbelievable- In a Bad Way: We bought this Thomas for our son who is a huge Thomas fan, and has a huge set up in his room. He has both the Thomas(this product, bought somewhere else) and the Percy model. The Thomas we had stopped working, and was a older model, so we bought this one to replace it. Our son was very upset when we had to retire his older Thomas, but we promised him a new one.We bought this product, and waited patiently to add it to our son's Thomas collection. When it came, we opened it right away, and were shocked when we were looking at the Percy instead of Thomas.We coulda/woulda/shoulda contacted the seller, but this "Thomas" product is already in our Tildsmen shed, since we opened the package with our son.With so many places to buy genuine Thomas gear, if you are paying the premium Thomas price, we expected a better product experience.
__label__1 Almost Great, Until it Broke...: My son recieved this as a birthday gift 2 months ago. He LOVED it even though it didn't corner well on our Mellissa and Doug train track. He mostly let it run on the floor, not the track, so that wasn't that big of an issue. It did, however, break after one fall from counter height. My son let it drive off the kitchen counter and after only 2 short months it is officially broken. It can still be played with but because it is meant to be motor driven it doesn't work that well as a push-powered train. Overall I'm disappointed, a toy that only last 2 months just isn't worth it.
__label__1 Disappointed !!!: I bought this toy for my son who loves the "Thomas" toys. You need one battery to operate the train and it seems to work well - it can pull other cars quite weel and climb up and down the tracks. However, what I was not happy with was the advertizing on the box - which clearly stated that the toy can be also be pushed manually by the child. THIS IS NOT TRUE (unless I had two faulty trains)!! My son likes to watch the train pull the cars on its own, but he also like to the the pushing himself. You are not able to do that with this train. It is just meant for watching.
__label__2 Classic Jessica Mitford: This is a compilation of a wide range of Mitford's articles, the best of which, such as her skewering of the "Famous Writers' School", are timeless classics. This is a superb collection, and a complete delight to read.
