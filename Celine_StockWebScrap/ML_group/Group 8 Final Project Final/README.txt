1. Extract all the files in the compressed folder.

2. Open "Preprocessing code.py" and RUN the code. A new Excel file named "Newdata1.xlsx" should be seen in the place where the files were extracted.

3. For the model training and evaluation code, there are TWO option:
    Option 1: Open "Final Project code.ipynb" on Jupyter Notebook and RUN the code.
    Option 2: Open "Final Project code.py" with any Python IDE and RUN the code. For this option, if there is an error "cannot import name 'pad_sequences' from 'keras.utils.data_utils'", please change 'keras.utils.data_utils' to 'keras.preprocessing.sequence' and try to run the code again.
