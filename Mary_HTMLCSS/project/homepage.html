			<h1>Campaign ARouNd thE WORLD</h1>
			<p>
				Specific Outcome: A two-week social media campaign called "ARouNdthEWORLD" was created to fill up some gaps in Arne's present social media strategy. The campaign will run from December 15 to December 27, 2023, and it will emphasize Facebook and Instagram, the two channels where the business is most active. This is all the key points have been provided. The campaign proposal aims to encourage involvement and community, which can significantly increase platform engagement rates. The campaign is going to start from 15th of December until 27th of December and it is hold online first, then face to face campaigns are hold in Sydney and Melbourne by providing Arne pop-up stores. The main objective is to raise interaction by 20% on Instagram and 30% on Facebook, which includes raising brand awareness and increasing website traffic. Increases in engagement, follower growth, website click-through rates, and sales conversions are all success indicators. These measures are in line with the objectives and are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) as the success metrics. To give followers additional value and foster brand loyalty, the campaign makes use of Arne's strengths in sustainability and moral production as the rationale of this campaign.
