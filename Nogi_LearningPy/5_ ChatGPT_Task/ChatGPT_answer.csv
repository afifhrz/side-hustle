0,1,Kuniaki Mihara,2022,"Environmental satisfaction, mood and cognitive performance in semi-outdoor space in the tropics ","The use of semi-outdoor space for the well-being of occupants is promoted in the tropics. Although a semi- 
outdoor space is often used for break space, environmental satisfaction and work performance are unclear in 
a semi-outdoor space as work activity space compared with air-conditioned (AC) room. This study focuses on the 
use of semi-outdoor space for short-term work activities such as office work and meetings. Experiments were 
carried  out  to  evaluate  environmental  satisfaction,  mood  and  cognitive  performance  in  the  cool  and  warm 
seasons in an AC room and a semi-outdoor space in Singapore. Eighty-nine participants answered questionnaires 
and conducted cognitive performance tests of Stroop test, visual backward digit span test, typing test and mind 
map test for 70 min per case in the AC room and semi-outdoor space with or without the operation of a ceiling 
fan. We analyzed the relationships among environmental satisfaction, mood, work performance by Structural 
Equation Modeling. The conditions which 80% of participants accepted in the semi-outdoor space were thermal 
environment ranged from 23.3  ◦ C to 30.1  ◦ C SET*, lighting levels of more than 260 lx and noise levels of less than 
48 dBA. No differences in cognitive performance were found between the AC room and semi-outdoor space (p  >
0.05). Mood influenced work performance (p  < 0.001) while environmental satisfaction did not (p  = 0.28). Self- 
reported performance, especially stress, influenced creativity (p  = 0.047). These findings lead to the possibility of 
short-term work activities in the semi-outdoor space without a decrease in work performance.  ",Yes,1
1,2,Qi Meng,2021,Effects of acoustic environment on design work performance based on multitask visual cognitive performance in office space ,"The acoustic environment in the office space is a significant factor affecting workers ’  performance. Whereas 
existing  research  focuses mainly  on  the impact  of  the  acoustic  environment on  single visual  cognitive  work 
performance,  this  study  considers  multitask  visual  cognitive  work.  Forty-one  respondents  were  selected  to 
participate in the multitask visual cognitive – behavioural cognitive experiment under different acoustic envi-
ronments. The effects of different typical sound source types, sound pressure levels, and reverberation times on 
the  performance  of  multitask  visual  cognition  in  design  offices  were  examined.  The  results  revealed  the 
following. First, the sound source types have a significant impact on the reaction time of participants ’  work 
performance. Compared to the ambient environment (mean  = 2.838 s), the reaction time performance is shortest 
under  music  sound  (mean  = 2.560  s).  Second,  the  increase  in  traffic  noise  and  air-conditioning  noise  will 
significantly reduce the memory accuracy of the location. For instance, when the traffic noise increases from 50 
dBA to 65 dBA, the memory accuracy of the location is reduced by 4.42%. Third, the increase in the rever-
beration of speech will effectively shorten the reaction time and increase the memory accuracy of graphics. As 
the reverberation time of speech increases from 0.3 s to 1.5 s, the reaction time is reduced by 0.274 s. Meanwhile, 
2.03% of the memory accuracy of graphics increased. Furthermore, the personal characteristics of the partici-
pants also affected visual cognitive work. Therefore, it is expected to improve the visual cognitive work per-
formance of employees for room acoustic design.   ",Yes,1
2,3,Zhaoming Li,2022,Regulating effects of the biophilic environment with strawberry plants on psychophysiological health and cognitive performance in small spaces,"With urbanization, pandemic isolation, and exploration of deep-space and deep-sea, human beings will inevi-
tably face the situation of long-term living and working in small spaces, which has negative impacts on people ’ s 
mental health and cognitive performance. One of the solutions to these problems is to introduce biophilic design, 
in which plants are often the momentous elements. But research quantifying psychophysiological and cognitive 
benefits of edible plants is sparse. This inter-group study chose strawberry, a typical favorite fruit, to explore the 
impact of the biophilic environment with edible plants on health and cognition in small spaces. A subjective 
evaluation  + electrophysiology  + salivary secretion analysis method was adopted to discuss the mechanisms 
operating between biophilic environment and human psychophysiological and cognitive feedback, and reveal 
the laws of interaction between them. The results indicated that subjective emotions were significantly improved, 
and  high-frequency  power  of  heart  rate  variability  (HRV),  the  power  of  alpha  and  beta  brainwaves  were 
increased, while heart rate, saliva cortisol,  α -amylase and IL-1 β  were reduced in the biophilic environment with 
strawberry plants. Moreover, the results highlighted an improvement in cognitive performance by introducing 
strawberry plants into small space. Correlation analysis revealed that vigor was significantly negatively corre-
lated with melatonin and response time, while histidine was positively correlated with mood disturbance and 
response time. Overall, these findings shed light on the positive regulation of biophilic environment with edible 
plants on people ’ s emotion and cognition.   ",Yes,1
3,4,Naoe Nishihara,2022,Effect of adaptive opportunity on cognitive performance in warm environments,"This study investigates the hypothesis that thermal adaptive opportunities available to building occupants affect their cognitive performance and mental workload. The change rate of cerebral blood ﬂow (Δtotal Hb) was measured by Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) and interpreted as the metric of mental workload in subjects while performing cognitive tasks (n-back tests) with, or without access to thermal adaptive opportunities such as regulable fan induced air ﬂow and clothing insulation adjustment. Participants underwent three experimental conditions: Condition 22 (operative temperature t o = 22 °C without adaptive opportunities), Condition 28 (t o = 28 °C without adaptive opportunities), and Condition 28w (t o = 28 °C with adaptive opportunities. Under Condition 28w, thermal sensations were neutral, while thermal satisfaction and comfort levels were higher than those reported for Condition 28, and the same as those reported under Condition 22. The subjects' mean skin temperature under Condition 22 was the lowest at 32.1 °C, followed by Condition 28w at 33.6 °C, while the highest, 34.5 °C was recorded in Condition 28. No signiﬁcant differences were observed in accuracy and reaction time of n-back tests between the three different environmental conditions. Under Condition 28w, mental fatigue levels and the left side Δ total Hb results were lowest out of all three conditions, although the differences failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance. Availability of adaptive opportunities plays a role in expanding the range of thermal environmental conditions for optimal cognitive task performance in a moderately warm environment (t o = 28 °C). This ﬁnding cannot be fully explained by the direct effect of adaptive behaviours on human heat balance and associated physiological responses, but the unexplained component may potentially be attributed to the psychological dimension of human adaptive response. These ﬁndings and their interpretation within an adaptive comfort framework are consistent with the extended-U hypothesis of cognitive performance.",Yes,1
4,5,Jie Yin,2018,Physiological and cognitive performance of exposure to biophilic indoor environment,"Biophilic design, which incorporates natural elements into the built environment, has received increasing at-
tention in both the design and health ﬁelds. But research quantifying physiological and cognitive beneﬁts of
indoor biophilic features is sparse. This randomized crossover study examines the physiological and cognitive
responses to natural elements in an oﬃce building. Twenty-eight participants spent time in an indoor en-
vironment featuring biophilic design elements and one without, with the order of the visit randomized. In each
visit, they experienced the environment for 5-min in reality and virtually by using virtual reality (VR). Wearable
sensors were used to measure blood pressure, galvanic skin response and heart rate. Cognitive tests were ad-
ministrated after each exposure. The indoor biophilic environment was associated with a decrease in partici-
pants' blood pressure. The overall diﬀerential eﬀects for participants experiencing an indoor environment with
biophilic elements versus none was 8.6 mmHg lower systolic and 3.6 mmHg lower diastolic blood pressure. In
addition, their skin conductance decreased 0.18 μS greater than when they experienced the non-biophilic setting.
Short-term memory improved by 14%. Participants reported a decrease in negative emotions and an increase in
positive emotions after experiencing the biophilic setting. Moreover, our ﬁndings indicate that participants
experiencing biophilic environment virtually had similar physiological and cognitive responses as when ex-
periencing the actual environment. This gives rise to the possibility of reducing stress and improving cognition
by using virtual reality to provide exposures to natural elements in a variety of indoor settings where access to
nature may not be possible.",Yes,1
5,6,Jiaxu Zhou,2023,Short-term exposure to indoor PM2.5 in office buildings and cognitive performance in adults: An intervention study,"Impacts of exposure to particulate matter can be wide-ranging, with some evidence suggesting potential impacts 
on nervous system, cognition, and productivity. However, most evidence to date addresses ambient exposure and 
chronic outcomes with limited research on indoor short-term exposure to PM2.5 and cognitive performance. 
Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate if there is a relationship between short-term exposure to indoor 
PM2.5 within the workplace context and cognitive performance in adults. 
A randomized single-blind cross-over trial was conducted in an urban mixed-mode ventilated office in Beijing 
(China). Sixty eligible employees participated in the study and fifty-five  valid responses were obtained. Cognitive 
performance was assessed with a validated neurological battery test during intervention and control conditions. 
Portable air purifiers were placed on the subjects ’  workstations and used in the intervention condition to control 
PM2.5 levels at the subjects ’  breathing zone whereas in the control condition, the air purifiers were present but 
switched off. Average PM2.5 levels were respectively 18.0  μ g/m 3  and 3.7  μ g/m 3  in the control and intervention 
condition. In each condition, cognitive performance testing started five to 7 h after arriving in the office. 
The results showed office workers had significantly better performance for 9 out of the 16 cognitive skills 
during  the  intervention,  compared  to  the  control  condition,  with  the  most  consistent  effect  in  the  memory 
domain. This study adds evidence that elevated PM2.5 levels can detrimentally affect cognitive performance 
even during short-term indoor exposure. Further research is needed on the potential impact of other air pol-
lutants, including ultrafine particles, and on the possible role of sound and air movement from the air purifiers.   ",Yes,1
6,7,Jessica K. Ljungberg,2007,"Stress, subjective experience and cognitive performance during exposure to noise and vibration","This study investigates the effects of noise and whole-body vibration on saliva cortisol levels and subjectively rated difﬁculty and stress while performing cognitive tasks. In the ﬁrst experiment, 24 men completed a logical reasoning task and a short-term memory task while, on separate occasions, being exposed to noise, vibration, combined stimuli, and control conditions. The environmental stimuli were designed to simulate the exposure from a forestry vehicle. The main ﬁnding was that participants made signiﬁcantly higher ratings of stress when the noise stimulus was present, either alone or in combination with vibration. There were, however, some indications that noise sensitivity might moderate both subjective and objective measures such as higher ratings of stress and elevated cortisol levels in high noise sensitive participants. A second experiment was conducted where noise sensitivity was used as an inclusion criterion. A low sensitive and a high sensitive group were created, each containing 16 participants. The results of the second experiment, found only marginal effects of noise sensitivity and no effects at all on performance or cortisol. Increased ratings of stress and difﬁculty were found whenever either environmental stressor was present, whether by itself or in combination. The same result was seen even when pooling the
data from both experiments. The main conclusion of the study is that relatively short exposures to noise and vibration typical of those levels that are found in industrial vehicles do not signiﬁcantly affect performance in cognitive tasks nor saliva cortisol levels even if work in these environments can be experienced as more difﬁcult or stressful.",Yes,1
7,8,Wei Luo,2023,"Effects of correlated color temperature of light on thermal comfort, thermophysiology and cognitive performance ","Anecdotal evidence suggests that the correlated color temperature (CCT) of light can affect thermal comfort. 
Previous literature mostly investigated this effect over a short duration ( < 1 h) and often attributed it to the hue- 
heat hypothesis (color-temperature association), which posits that the visual experience of blue colors (high CCT) 
results in a cooler temperature sensation than red/yellow colors (low CCT) do. However, with longer duration, 
non-visual effects of CCT that elicit physiological changes may be at play additionally. Therefore, we contrasted 
two CCTs with relatively long exposures ( > 2 h; 2700 K vs. 5700 K with 500 lux illuminance at the eye) in office- 
like settings during mild cold exposure (17  ◦ C) using a within-subject design (N  = 16). The results indicate that 
CCT did not significantly affect thermal sensation in mild cold, which may be explained by the large interin-
dividual variation in the color-temperature association. Interestingly, 5700 K even improved thermal comfort, 
decreased perceived shivering, and, after 1-h exposure, increased energy expenditure. Moreover, visual comfort 
was not significantly moderated by CCT, but 5700 K improved comprehensive cognitive performance. Concur-
rently, arousal and alertness were higher in 5700 K, potentially indicating greater non-visual effects in 5700 K. 
Further  analysis  revealed  that  thermal  comfort  significantly  correlated  with  perceived  shivering  and  visual 
comfort, but not with the color sensation of the light. Together, the results provide no support for the hue-heat 
hypothesis under mildly cold conditions and suggest that high CCT enhanced thermal comfort, alertness, arousal, 
and cognitive performance, likely via non-visual mechanisms that built up over longer exposure durations.  ",Yes,1
8,9,Won Hee Ko,2020,"The impact of a view from a window on thermal comfort, emotion, and cognitive performance ","Visual connection to nature has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on attention restoration, stress 
reduction, and overall health and well-being. Inside buildings, windows are the primary means of providing a 
connection to the outdoors, and nature views even through a window may have similar effects on the occupants. 
Given that humans recognize environments through multi-sensory integration, a window view may also affect 
occupants ’  thermal  perception.  We  assessed  the  influence  of  having  a  window  with  a  view  on  thermal  and 
emotional  responses  as  well as  on  cognitive  performance.  We  conducted  a randomized  crossover  laboratory 
experiment with 86 participants, in spaces with and without windows. The chamber kept the air and window 
surface temperature at 28  � C, a slightly warm condition. The outcome measures consisted of subjective evalu-
ations (e.g., thermal perception, emotion), skin temperature measurements and cognitive performance tests. In 
the space with versus without windows, the thermal sensation was significantly cooler (0.3 thermal sensation 
vote; equivalent to 0.74  � C lower), and 12% more participants were thermally comfortable. Positive emotions (e. 
g., happy, satisfied) were higher and negative emotions (e.g., sad, drowsy) were lower for the participants in the 
window  versus  the  windowless  condition.  Working  memory  and  the  ability  to  concentrate  were  higher  for 
participants in the space with versus without windows, but there were no significant differences in short-term 
memory, planning, and creativity performance. Considering the multiple effects of window access, providing 
a window with a view in a workplace is important for the comfort, emotion, and working memory and con-
centration of occupants.  ",Yes,1
9,10,Hui Zhu,2023,Effects of hot-humid exposure on human cognitive performance under sustained multi-tasks,"Compromised cognitive performances under hot and humid environment have been widely reported in
recent years, as the extreme climate events come more frequently and intensively. In order to evaluate
the cognitive performance under hot-humid exposure, the skin temperature, core temperature and the
heart rate of 14 right-handed male participants were measured when they were conducting 5 different
kinds of cognitive tasks under hot-humid environments at 32, 35, 38, 41 _x0001_C and RH 70 %. Each session
consisted of these 5 tasks with different orders followed the Latin Square Design. And the session was
repeated in the whole experiment till each participant refused to continue. Results showed that the mean
skin temperature (T msk ) increased during the hot-humid exposures, which was attributed to the air tem-
peratures and the exposure time. Furthermore, the mean accuracy and response time of these tasks were
negatively related with each other. A U-shape relation between the T msk and mean accuracies was
observed, while an Inverted-U relation between the T msk and the mean response time was detected.
Finally, a 4th order-function paradigm was acquired between the T msk and the relative cognitive perfor-
mance (RCP). In terms of the results, the small T msk range from 36.0 _x0001_C to 37.25 _x0001_C was presented, within
which the stable RCP were observed, while out of which the RCP deteriorated. The ﬁndings provided a
potential solution for the evaluation of the cognitive performance under hot-humid exposures.",Yes,1
10,11,Sarah Crosby,2021,"Correlations between thermal satisfaction and non-thermal conditions of 
indoor environmental quality: Bayesian inference of a field study of offices ","The judgment of thermal comfort is a cognitive process influenced by physical, psychological and other factors. 
Prior studies have suggested that occupants who are generally satisfied with many non-thermal conditions of 
indoor environmental quality (IEQ) are also more likely to be satisfied with thermal conditions as well. This 
paper applies Bayesian logistic regression to identify and predict the independent relationship between non- 
thermal metrics of IEQ, such as CO2  concentrations, noise levels, and light levels, and perceived thermal com-
fort. The study is the first to do so with respect to a large field study. The regression analysis is done against a 
dataset of objective and subjective IEQ measurements collected from 779 occupants of open-plan offices in large 
Canadian and US cities. The results suggest there is evidence supporting a view that measurements of indoor CO2 
concentrations and indoor speech intelligibility are correlated with perceived thermal satisfaction. For example, 
a posteriori predictions drawn from the regression model suggest that, under the same psychrometric conditions 
(i.e., operative temperature  = 23  ◦ C, relative humidity  = 30%, etc.), occupants experiencing indoor CO2  con-
centrations of 500 ppm were ~30  ± 8% more likely to state they felt thermally satisfied than occupants expe-
riencing indoor conditions at 900 ppm.   ",No,0
